# Texturize
A unified framework for example-based Texture Synthesis, developed alongside my master's thesis.

This repository is currently a placeholder, used to provide meaningful URL's within my thesis. The actual code is currently developed within a private Visual Studio Online (VSO) repository and will be migrated after the work has been submitted.

## What to expect?

Currently I am researching methologies and concepts to extent example-based Texture Synthesis towards materials for Physically Based Rendering (PBR). The actual synthesizer is influenced by the papers of Sylvain Lefebvre and Hugues Hoppe [LH06][LH07], whose sample implementation does not seam to be around the web any longer. I based my research on their *Appearance Space Texture Synthesis* (ASTS) algorithm, so everybody who is interested in a reference implementation may find this helpful.
